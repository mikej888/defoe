# Import data into Urika

Urika compute nodes have no network access and so cannot access remote datasets.

To transfer data into Urika, see [Data transfer to and from the Turing's Cray Urika-GX service](https://ati-rescomp-service-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cray/data-transfer.html) in the [Alan Turing Institute Research Computing Service](https://ati-rescomp-service-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation.
